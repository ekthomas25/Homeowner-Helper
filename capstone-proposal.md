# Capstone Proposal

## Name of Student: Liz Thomas

## Name of Project: Homeowner Helper

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

The project's purpose is to keep track of all of the regular home maintenance that a homeowner needs to do. It will log when you complete a maintenance task and give you the option to forecast when you need to complete it next, ie monthly maintence. The log has the option to include notes about each completed task so that you can reference when you repaired x and replaced y.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- User can view a task list
- User is able to complete and log a task
- User can view a forecast of when that task should be completed next
- User can view past logs of tasks to reference
- User can log in using authentication


## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

JavaScript
React
CSS
HTML
Firebase
Moment.js

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Calendar View
- Ideally, there will be a calendar portion of the application where you can view upcoming tasks

In App Reminder 
- A notification when a task is soon approaching.

Email Reminder
- An email or text message is sent when the task is soon approaching.

Ability to upload photos
- Save photos to each log for reference

Tool/Material Library
- Ability to keep track of the tools or materials you buy and lets you add input on the condition of tools, where they're kept, and qty of the material you have left after initial use (ie purchased 6pk of lightbulbs but only replaced 1)

Cost Keeper
- Track the amount you spend on each task and be able to see total calculations for the month, season, or year.

Heat Map
- Shows frequency throughout the year that you complete each task

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- visx/heatmap or nivio/calendar?
- Email.js
- MUI
- DevExtreme Scheduler or react-big-calendar or something similar?

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

I still have a lot of research to do to figure out potential tools, libraries, etc!
